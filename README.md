# Student-Performance-Dashboard
I have created an interactive dashboard using Power BI that provides key insights into student performance in academics. The dashboard presents important and useful information to help analyze various performance metrics, trends, and comparisons across subjects and students.

üîç Project Highlights:
Power BI Visualizations: Utilized various interactive charts and visuals to present the data clearly and effectively.

DAX Functions: Implemented DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to perform calculations and create custom measures.

ETL Operations: Performed data cleaning and transformation steps to prepare the dataset for accurate analysis.

Data Source: The project uses an Excel file (Student_Performance_Data.xlsx) as the data source, which is also included in this repository.

üí° Key Features:
Subject-wise and student-wise academic performance analysis

Overall score trends and comparison metrics

Easy-to-understand visuals for better decision-making
